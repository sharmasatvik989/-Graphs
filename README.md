# -Graphs
Graphical Representation of Large dataset.

The assignment is to visualize and display the results from your previous assignment    within a browser, allow a user to select intervals or attributes in a data set, show   results as a pie chart, a histogram, or a scatter or point chart (possibly connected:   with a line). 

1. Allow a user, through a web form, to give a latitude range, (for example -10 to 20)and for each interval of 10 degrees (for this example -10 to 0, 0 to 10, etc.)display a horizontal bar chart where each bar represents the total number of volcanoswithin that latitude range.For each bar, please show labels outside each.Display the chart on that page, which is at least 3/4 (75 to 90%) the width of the screen.

2. Allow a user, through a web form, to give a country name, and display a pie chart where eachpie slice is a longitude range for all volcanos, in intervals of 10 degrees, for that country.Each pie slice should be in a different color, please show labels inside each slice.Display the chart on that page, which is at least 3/4 (75 to 90%) the width of the screen.

3. Allow a user, through a web form, to give a volcano number (first column) range.Then calculate VN = volcano number/1000 {or multiply by 0.001}Then plot (point chart or scatter diagram) VN as the x axis and longitude on the y axis,for each volcano in that range.Please do not set origin (bottom left) point at 0,0 unless necessary,and scale the axis so that it fits on the screen.
